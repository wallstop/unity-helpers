# Getting Started with Unity Helpers

**Welcome! You're about to save yourself weeks of repetitive work.**

Unity Helpers is a battle-tested toolkit that eliminates the boring, repetitive code you're tired of writing. This guide gets you productive in 5 minutes, whether you're a beginner or a senior engineer.

## What Makes This Worth Your Time?

**Three core principles that save you actual hours:**

### 1. 🎯 Zero Boilerplate

**APIs that handle the tedious stuff:**

- Random selection with weights? → `random.NextWeightedIndex(weights)`
- Auto-wire components? → `[SiblingComponent] private Animator animator;`
- Gaussian distribution? Perlin noise? → Built-in, one method call

**Self-documenting code:**

```csharp
[SiblingComponent] private Animator animator;                      // Clear intent
[ParentComponent(OnlyAncestors = true)] private Rigidbody2D rb;  // Explicit search
[ChildComponent(MaxDepth = 1)] private Collider2D[] colliders;   // Limited scope
```

**Helpful errors that save debugging time:**

- Missing components? → Full GameObject path + component type
- Invalid queries? → Explanation of what went wrong + how to fix it
- Schema issues? → Specific guidance for your serialization problem

### 2. ⚡ Performance-Proven

**Measurable speed improvements:**

- **10-15x faster** random generation (655M ops/sec vs 65M ops/sec)
- **100x faster** reflection (2ns vs 200ns field access)
- **O(log n)** spatial queries scale to millions of objects
- **Zero GC** with buffering pattern

**Real-world impact:**

- Stable 60 FPS with 1000+ AI agents querying neighbors
- No allocation spikes from pooled collections
- Deterministic replays with seedable RNG

### 3. ✅ Production-Ready

**Quality you can trust:**

- ✅ **4,000+ automated tests** - Edge cases covered before you hit them
- ✅ **Shipped in commercial games** - Battle-tested at scale
- ✅ **IL2CPP/WebGL compatible** - Works with aggressive compilers
- ✅ **Schema evolution** - Player saves never break from updates
- ✅ **SINGLE_THREADED optimized** - 10-20% faster on WebGL

**What this means for you:**

- Ship confidently knowing edge cases are handled
- No "works in editor but not in build" surprises
- Update your game without corrupting player data

## Choose Your Path

### 🎯 Path 1: "I Have a Specific Problem"

Jump directly to the solution you need:

**Performance Issues?**

- Slow random number generation → [Random Generators](#random-in-60-seconds)

  }
}
```

Or in Unity:

1. Open **Window > Package Manager**
2. Click **+** → **Add package from git URL...**
3. Enter: `https://github.com/wallstop/unity-helpers.git`

### Verify Installation

Check that the package appears in Package Manager under "Custom". You should see:

## Three Quick Wins (5 Minutes)

<a id="random-in-60-seconds"></a>

### 1. Random in 60 Seconds 🟢 Beginner

**Problem:** Unity's `UnityEngine.Random` is slow and not seedable.

**Solution:**

```csharp
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Random;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Extension;

public class LootDrop : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // 10-15x faster than UnityEngine.Random
        IRandom rng = PRNG.Instance;

        // Basic usage
        int damage = rng.Next(10, 20);
        float chance = rng.NextFloat();

        // Advanced: weighted random selection
        string[] loot = { "Common", "Rare", "Epic", "Legendary" };
        float[] weights = { 0.6f, 0.25f, 0.10f, 0.05f };
        int index = rng.NextWeightedIndex(weights);
        Debug.Log($"Dropped: {loot[index]}");
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Don't use `UnityEngine.Random` and `PRNG.Instance` together in the
> same class - pick one and stick with it for consistent results.

<a id="component-wiring-in-60-seconds"></a>

### 2. Component Wiring in 60 Seconds 🟢 Beginner

**Problem:** Writing `GetComponent` calls everywhere is tedious and error-prone.

**Solution:**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;

public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Auto-finds SpriteRenderer on same GameObject
    [SiblingComponent]
    private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer;

    // Auto-finds Rigidbody2D in parent hierarchy
    [ParentComponent]
    private Rigidbody2D rigidbody;

    // Auto-finds all Collider2D in immediate children only
    [ChildComponent(OnlyDescendants = true, MaxDepth = 1)]
    private Collider2D[] childColliders;

    void Awake()
    {
        // One call wires everything!
        this.AssignRelationalComponents();

        // Now use them
        spriteRenderer.color = Color.red;
        rigidbody.velocity = Vector2.up * 5f;
        Debug.Log($"Found {childColliders.Length} child colliders");
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Don't call `AssignRelationalComponents()` in `Update()` -
> it should only run once during initialization (Awake/Start).

#### Using With DI Containers (VContainer/Zenject)

- If you use dependency injection, you can auto-populate relational fields right after DI injection.
- Quick setup:
  - VContainer: in `LifetimeScope.Configure`, call `builder.RegisterRelationalComponents()`.
  - Zenject: add `RelationalComponentsInstaller` to your `SceneContext` and (optionally) enable the scene scan on initialize.

### 3. Spatial Queries in 60 Seconds 🟡 Intermediate

**Problem:** Finding nearby objects with `FindObjectsOfType` and distance checks is O(n) and slow.

**Solution:**

```csharp
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.DataStructure;
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class EnemyManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private QuadTree2D<Enemy> enemyTree;
    private List<Enemy> nearbyBuffer = new(64); // Reusable buffer

    void Start()
    {
        // Build tree once (O(n log n))
        Enemy[] enemies = FindObjectsOfType<Enemy>();
        enemyTree = new QuadTree2D<Enemy>(enemies, e => e.transform.position);
    }

    public List<Enemy> GetEnemiesNearPlayer(Vector2 playerPos, float radius)
    {
        nearbyBuffer.Clear();

        // Fast query: O(log n) instead of O(n)
        enemyTree.GetElementsInRange(playerPos, radius, nearbyBuffer);

        return nearbyBuffer;
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Spatial trees are **immutable** - you must rebuild the tree
> when enemy positions change. For frequently moving objects, use `SpatialHash2D` instead.
