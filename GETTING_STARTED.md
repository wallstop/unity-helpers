# Getting Started with Unity Helpers

Welcome! Unity Helpers is a comprehensive toolkit designed to make Unity development faster,
more reliable, and more enjoyable. This guide will help you get started based on your learning style.

## What Makes Unity Helpers Special?

Unity Helpers isn't just another utility library - it's built on three core principles:

### 1. Developer-Friendly First

**Extensive APIs that handle edge cases you'd otherwise code manually:**

- Random selection with weights? One method call.
- Weighted bool with probability? Built-in.
- Gaussian distribution? Perlin noise maps? Already there.

**Self-documenting attributes and patterns:**

```csharp
[SiblingComponent] private Animator animator;  // Clear intent
[ParentComponent(OnlyAncestors = true)] private Rigidbody2D rb;  // Explicit search
[ChildComponent(MaxDepth = 1)] private Collider2D[] colliders;  // Limited scope
```

**Fail-fast with helpful error messages:**

- Missing required components? Detailed logs with GameObject names and paths.
- Invalid spatial tree queries? Clear explanations of what went wrong.
- Schema evolution issues? Specific guidance on fixing serialization problems.

### 2. Performance-Backed

**10-15x faster random generation:**

- `PRNG.Instance` vs `UnityEngine.Random`: 655M ops/sec vs 65M ops/sec
- Thread-safe via thread-local instances
- Fully seedable for deterministic gameplay

**Zero-allocation spatial queries:**

- Buffering pattern eliminates GC spikes
- Reusable collections keep frame times stable
- O(log n) trees scale to millions of objects

**IL-emitted reflection:**

- 10-100x faster than System.Reflection
- Field access: ~2ns vs ~200ns (100x speedup)
- IL2CPP safe and fully tested

### 3. Production-Ready

**4,000+ automated test cases:**

- Cover edge cases you haven't thought of
- Run before each release to catch regressions
- Prevent bugs before they reach your players

**Used in shipped commercial games:**

- Battle-tested in real production environments
- Performance-critical paths proven at scale
- API stability from real-world feedback

**Protobuf schema evolution:**

- Add/remove fields without breaking old saves
- Players never lose progress from updates
- Forward and backward compatible serialization

**IL2CPP and WebGL optimized:**

- Works with Unity's aggressive compiler
- No reflection issues in release builds
- Full AOT compatibility
- SINGLE_THREADED define for optimized WebGL hot paths
- 10-20% faster on single-threaded platforms

## Choose Your Path

### 🎯 Path 1: "I Have a Specific Problem"

Jump directly to the solution you need:

**Performance Issues?**

- Slow random number generation → [Random Generators](#random-in-60-seconds)
- Too many objects to search → [Spatial Queries](#spatial-queries-in-60-seconds)
- Frame drops from allocations → [Buffering Pattern](README.md#buffering-pattern)

**Workflow Issues?**

- Writing too much GetComponent → [Auto Component Wiring](#component-wiring-in-60-seconds)
- Manual sprite animation setup → [Editor Tools](EDITOR_TOOLS_GUIDE.md)
- Prefab validation problems → [Prefab Checker](EDITOR_TOOLS_GUIDE.md#prefab-checker)

**Architecture Issues?**

- Need global settings → [Singletons](SINGLETONS.md)
- Need buff/debuff system → [Effects System](EFFECTS_SYSTEM.md)
- Need save/load system → [Serialization](SERIALIZATION.md)

## Installation (60 Seconds)

### Unity Package Manager (Recommended)

Add to your `Packages/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.wallstop-studios.unity-helpers": "https://github.com/wallstop/unity-helpers.git"
  }
}
```

Or in Unity:

1. Open **Window > Package Manager**
2. Click **+** → **Add package from git URL...**
3. Enter: `https://github.com/wallstop/unity-helpers.git`

### Verify Installation

Check that the package appears in Package Manager under "Custom". You should see:

- **Name:** Unity Helpers
- **Version:** (current version)
- **Author:** Wallstop Studios

## Three Quick Wins (5 Minutes)

<a id="random-in-60-seconds"></a>

### 1. Random in 60 Seconds 🟢 Beginner

**Problem:** Unity's `UnityEngine.Random` is slow and not seedable.

**Solution:**

```csharp
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Random;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Extension;

public class LootDrop : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // 10-15x faster than UnityEngine.Random
        IRandom rng = PRNG.Instance;

        // Basic usage
        int damage = rng.Next(10, 20);
        float chance = rng.NextFloat();

        // Advanced: weighted random selection
        string[] loot = { "Common", "Rare", "Epic", "Legendary" };
        float[] weights = { 0.6f, 0.25f, 0.10f, 0.05f };
        int index = rng.NextWeightedIndex(weights);
        Debug.Log($"Dropped: {loot[index]}");
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Don't use `UnityEngine.Random` and `PRNG.Instance` together in the
> same class - pick one and stick with it for consistent results.

<a id="component-wiring-in-60-seconds"></a>

### 2. Component Wiring in 60 Seconds 🟢 Beginner

**Problem:** Writing `GetComponent` calls everywhere is tedious and error-prone.

**Solution:**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;

public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Auto-finds SpriteRenderer on same GameObject
    [SiblingComponent]
    private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer;

    // Auto-finds Rigidbody2D in parent hierarchy
    [ParentComponent]
    private Rigidbody2D rigidbody;

    // Auto-finds all Collider2D in immediate children only
    [ChildComponent(OnlyDescendants = true, MaxDepth = 1)]
    private Collider2D[] childColliders;

    void Awake()
    {
        // One call wires everything!
        this.AssignRelationalComponents();

        // Now use them
        spriteRenderer.color = Color.red;
        rigidbody.velocity = Vector2.up * 5f;
        Debug.Log($"Found {childColliders.Length} child colliders");
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Don't call `AssignRelationalComponents()` in `Update()` -
> it should only run once during initialization (Awake/Start).

#### Using With DI Containers (VContainer/Zenject)

- If you use dependency injection, you can auto-populate relational fields right after DI injection.
- Quick setup:
  - VContainer: in `LifetimeScope.Configure`, call `builder.RegisterRelationalComponents()`.
  - Zenject: add `RelationalComponentsInstaller` to your `SceneContext` and (optionally) enable the scene scan on initialize.

### 3. Spatial Queries in 60 Seconds 🟡 Intermediate

**Problem:** Finding nearby objects with `FindObjectsOfType` and distance checks is O(n) and slow.

**Solution:**

```csharp
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.DataStructure;
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class EnemyManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private QuadTree2D<Enemy> enemyTree;
    private List<Enemy> nearbyBuffer = new(64); // Reusable buffer

    void Start()
    {
        // Build tree once (O(n log n))
        Enemy[] enemies = FindObjectsOfType<Enemy>();
        enemyTree = new QuadTree2D<Enemy>(enemies, e => e.transform.position);
    }

    public List<Enemy> GetEnemiesNearPlayer(Vector2 playerPos, float radius)
    {
        nearbyBuffer.Clear();

        // Fast query: O(log n) instead of O(n)
        enemyTree.GetElementsInRange(playerPos, radius, nearbyBuffer);

        return nearbyBuffer;
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Spatial trees are **immutable** - you must rebuild the tree
> when enemy positions change. For frequently moving objects, use `SpatialHash2D` instead.
