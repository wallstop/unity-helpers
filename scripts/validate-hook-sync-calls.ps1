.SYNOPSIS
    Validates that pre-commit hook calls all required sync scripts and
    pre-push hook reads stdin for changed-file detection.
.DESCRIPTION
    Checks that the pre-commit hook invokes all required version sync scripts:
      - sync-banner-version.ps1
      - sync-issue-template-versions.ps1

    Also validates the pre-push hook reads stdin to determine changed files
    (critical for performance — without this, pre-push scans the entire repo).

    This prevents regressions where new sync scripts are added to the
    repository but not wired into the pre-commit hook.
.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/validate-hook-sync-calls.ps1
