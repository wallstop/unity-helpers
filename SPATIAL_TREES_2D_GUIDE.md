# 2D Spatial Trees ‚Äî Concepts and Usage

This practical guide complements performance and semantics pages with diagrams and actionable selection advice.

## TL;DR ‚Äî What Problem This Solves

- You often need to answer: "What's near X?" or "What's inside this area?"
- **‚≠ê Naive loops are O(n) ‚Äî check every object. Spatial trees are O(log n) ‚Äî only check nearby objects.**
- **Result: 10-100x faster queries**, scaling from dozens to **millions** of objects.

### The Scaling Advantage

| Object Count | Naive Approach (checks) | Spatial Tree (checks) | Speedup |
|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| 100          | 100                     | ~7                    | 14x     |
| 1,000        | 1,000                   | ~10                   | 100x    |
| 10,000       | 10,000                  | ~13                   | 769x    |
| 100,000      | üíÄ Unplayable           | ~17                   | ‚àû       |

Quick picks
- Many moving points, frequent rebuilds, broad searches: QuadTree2D
- Static points, nearest‚Äëneighbor/k‚ÄëNN: KDTree2D (Balanced)
- Fast builds with good‚Äëenough queries on points: KDTree2D (Unbalanced)
- Objects with size (bounds), intersect/contain queries: RTree2D

## Quick Start (Code)

Points (QuadTree2D / KdTree2D)
```csharp
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.DataStructure;
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Example element with a position
struct Enemy { public Vector2 pos; public int id; }

var enemies = new List<Enemy>(/* fill with positions */);

// Build a tree from points
var quad = new QuadTree2D<Enemy>(enemies, e => e.pos);
var kd   = new KdTree2D<Enemy>(enemies, e => e.pos); // balanced by default

// Range query (circle)
var inRange = new List<Enemy>();
quad.GetElementsInRange(playerPos, 10f, inRange);

// Bounds (box) query
var inBox = new List<Enemy>();
kd.GetElementsInBounds(new Bounds(center, size), inBox);

// Approximate nearest neighbors
var neighbors = new List<Enemy>();
kd.GetApproximateNearestNeighbors(playerPos, count: 10, neighbors);
```

Sized objects (RTree2D)
```csharp
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.DataStructure;
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections.Generic;

struct Tile { public Bounds bounds; public int kind; }

var tiles = new List<Tile>(/* fill with bounds */);

// Build from bounds (AABBs)
var rtree = new RTree2D<Tile>(tiles, t => t.bounds);

// Bounds query (fast for large areas)
var hits = new List<Tile>();
rtree.GetElementsInBounds(worldBounds, hits);

// Range query (treats items by their bounds)
var near = new List<Tile>();
rtree.GetElementsInRange(center, radius, near);
```

Notes
- These trees are immutable: rebuild when positions/bounds change significantly.
- For lots of moving points, consider `SpatialHash2D` for broad‚Äëphase.
- See [Spatial Tree Semantics](SPATIAL_TREE_SEMANTICS.md) for boundary behavior and edge cases.

## ‚≠ê Zero-Allocation Queries: The Performance Killer Feature

**The Problem - GC Spikes Every Frame:**

```csharp
void Update()
{
    // üî¥ BAD: Allocates new List every frame
    List<Enemy> nearby = tree.GetElementsInRange(playerPos, 10f);

    foreach (Enemy e in nearby)
    {
        e.ReactToPlayer();
    }
    // Result: GC runs frequently = frame drops
}
```

**The Solution - Buffering Pattern:**

```csharp
// Reusable buffer (declare once)
private List<Enemy> nearbyBuffer = new(64);

void Update()
{
    nearbyBuffer.Clear();

    // üü¢ GOOD: Reuses same List = zero allocations
    tree.GetElementsInRange(playerPos, 10f, nearbyBuffer);

    foreach (Enemy e in nearbyBuffer)
    {
        e.ReactToPlayer();
    }
    // Result: No GC, stable 60fps
}
```

**Impact:**
- **Before:** GC spikes every 2-3 seconds, frame drops to 40fps
- **After:** Zero GC from queries, stable 60fps even with 1000s of queries/second

**All spatial trees support this pattern:**
- `QuadTree2D.GetElementsInRange(pos, radius, buffer)`
- `KdTree2D.GetElementsInBounds(bounds, buffer)`
- `RTree2D.GetElementsInRange(pos, radius, buffer)`

> üí° **Pro Tip:** Pre-size your buffers based on expected max results.
> `new List<Enemy>(64)` avoids internal resizing for results up to 64 items.

**Maximum Ergonomics:**

These APIs return the buffer you pass in, so you can use them directly in `foreach` loops:

```csharp
private List<Enemy> nearbyBuffer = new(64);

void Update()
{
    // Returns the same buffer - use it directly in foreach!
    foreach (Enemy e in tree.GetElementsInRange(playerPos, 10f, nearbyBuffer))
    {
        e.ReactToPlayer();
    }
}
```

**Using Pooled Buffers:**

Don't want to manage buffers yourself? Use the built-in pooling utilities:

```csharp
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Utils;

void Update()
{
    // Get pooled buffer - automatically returned when scope exits
    using var lease = Buffers<Enemy>.List.Get(out List<Enemy> buffer);

    // Use it directly in foreach - combines zero-alloc query + pooled buffer!
    foreach (Enemy e in tree.GetElementsInRange(playerPos, 10f, buffer))
    {
        e.ReactToPlayer();
    }
    // buffer automatically returned to pool here
}
```

See [Buffering Pattern](README.md#buffering-pattern) for the complete guide and [Pooling Utilities](README.md#pooling-utilities) for more pooling options.

## Structures

### QuadTree2D

- Partition: Recursively splits space into four quadrants.
- Use for: Broad-phase proximity, view culling, general spatial bucketing.
- Pros: Simple structure; predictable performance; incremental updates straightforward.
- Cons: Data hotspots deepen local trees; nearest neighbors slower than KDTree.

Diagram: ![QuadTree2D](Docs/Images/quadtree_2d.svg)

### KDTree2D

- Partition: Alternating axis-aligned splits (x/y), often median-balanced.
- Use for: Nearest neighbor, k-NN, range queries on points.
- Pros: Strong NN performance; balanced variant gives consistent query time.
- Cons: Costly to maintain under heavy churn; unbalanced variant can degrade.

### RTree2D

- Partition: Groups items by minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs) with hierarchical MBRs.
- Use for: Items with size (AABBs): sprites, tiles, colliders; bounds intersection.
- Pros: Great for large bounds queries; matches bounds semantics.
- Cons: Overlapping MBRs can increase node visits; not optimal for point NN.

              ‚Üí QuadTree2D ‚úì (best all-around choice)
```

### Quick Reference

- **Many moving points, rebuild or frequent updates:** QuadTree2D
- **Nearest neighbors on static points:** KDTree2D (Balanced)
- **Fast builds with good-enough queries:** KDTree2D (Unbalanced)
- **Objects with area; bounds queries primary:** RTree2D
- **Very frequent movement (every frame):** SpatialHash2D (see [README](README.md#choosing-spatial-structures))

## Query Semantics

- Points vs Bounds: QuadTree2D and KDTree2D are point-based; RTree2D is bounds-based.
- Boundary inclusion: normalize half-open vs closed intervals. Add epsilons for edge cases.
- Numeric stability: prefer consistent ordering for colinear and boundary points.
