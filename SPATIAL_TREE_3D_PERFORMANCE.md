# 3D Spatial Tree Performance Benchmarks

## TL;DR — What Problem This Solves

- Need fast “what’s near X?” or “what’s inside this volume?” in 3D.
- These structures avoid scanning every object; queries touch only nearby data.
- Quick picks: OctTree3D for general 3D queries; KDTree3D for nearest‑neighbor on points; RTree3D for volumetric bounds.

Note: KdTree3D, OctTree3D, and RTree3D are under active development and their APIs/performance may evolve. SpatialHash3D is stable and recommended for broad‑phase neighbor queries with many moving objects.

For boundary and result semantics across structures, see [Spatial Tree Semantics](SPATIAL_TREE_SEMANTICS.md)

This document contains performance benchmarks for the 3D spatial tree implementations in Unity Helpers.

## Available 3D Spatial Trees

- **OctTree3D** - Easiest to use, good all-around performance for 3D
- **KDTree3D** - Balanced and unbalanced variants available
- **RTree3D** - Optimized for 3D bounding box queries
- **SpatialHash3D** - Efficient for uniformly distributed moving objects (stable)

## Interpreting the Results

All numbers represent **operations per second** (higher is better), except for construction times which show operations per second and absolute time.

### Choosing the Right Tree

**OctTree3D**:
- Best for: General-purpose 3D spatial queries
- Strengths: Balanced performance, easy to use, good spatial locality
- Use cases: 3D collision detection, visibility culling, spatial audio

**KDTree3D (Balanced)**:
- Best for: Nearest-neighbor queries in 3D space
- Strengths: Fast point queries, good for smaller datasets
- Use cases: Pathfinding, AI spatial awareness, particle systems

**KDTree3D (Unbalanced)**:
- Best for: When you need fast construction and will rebuild frequently
- Strengths: Fastest construction, similar query performance to balanced
- Use cases: Dynamic environments, frequently changing spatial data

**RTree3D**:
- Best for: 3D bounding box queries, especially with volumetric data
- Strengths: Excellent for large bounding volumes, handles overlapping objects
- Use cases: Physics engines, frustum culling, volumetric effects

### Important Notes

- All spatial trees assume **immutable** positional data
- If positions change, you must reconstruct the tree
- Spatial queries are O(log n) vs O(n) for linear search
- 3D trees have higher construction costs than 2D variants due to additional dimension
- Construction cost is amortized over many queries
