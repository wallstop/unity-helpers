# Hulls (Convex vs Concave)

## TL;DR — When To Use Which

- Convex hull: fastest, safe outer bound; great for coarse collisions and visibility.
- Concave hull: follows shape detail; tunable fidelity vs. stability via k/alpha parameters.

This guide explains convex and concave hulls, when to use each, and how they differ.

## Convex Hull

- The smallest convex polygon that contains all points.
- Algorithms: Monotone Chain (a.k.a. Andrew’s), Graham Scan, Jarvis March.
- Characteristics
  - Always convex; no inward dents.
  - Stable and deterministic for fixed input.
  - Often used for coarse collision proxies, shape bounds, and visibility.

## Concave Hull

- A polygon that can indent to follow the shape of points more closely.
- Algorithms: k-nearest-neighbor based, alpha-shapes, ball-pivoting variants.
- Characteristics
  - Can capture shape detail; may exclude sparse outliers.
  - Parameterized by k (neighbors) or alpha (radius) controlling “concavity”.
  - May create holes or self-intersections if not constrained; validate output.

## Choosing Between Them

- Use convex hull when you need a fast, safe, and simple bound with predictable performance.
- Use concave hull when shape fidelity matters (e.g., silhouette, path enclosure) and you accept a tunable trade-off between detail and stability.

## Tips

- Preprocess: remove duplicate points and optionally simplify clusters.
- Postprocess: enforce clockwise/CCW winding and run self-intersection checks for concave hulls.
- Numerical stability: add small epsilons for collinear checks; include or exclude boundary points consistently.

## API Reference (Grid vs. Gridless)

All hull helpers now offer both grid-aware (`Grid` + `FastVector3Int`) and gridless variants so you can work directly with `Vector2`/`FastVector3Int` data:

- Convex hull
  - `points.BuildConvexHull(includeColinearPoints: false)` for pure `Vector2`.
  - `fastPoints.BuildConvexHull(includeColinearPoints: false)` for `FastVector3Int` without a `Grid`.
  - `fastPoints.BuildConvexHull(grid, includeColinearPoints: false)` when you need `Grid.CellToWorld` conversions.
  - Algorithm selection via `ConvexHullAlgorithm` is available for both gridful and gridless overloads.
- Concave hull
  - `vectorPoints.BuildConcaveHull(options)` / `BuildConcaveHullKnn` / `BuildConcaveHullEdgeSplit` for `Vector2`.
  - `fastPoints.BuildConcaveHull(options)` plus the `Knn`/`EdgeSplit` helpers for `FastVector3Int` without requiring a `Grid`.
  - `fastPoints.BuildConcaveHull(grid, options)` remains available when your data lives in grid space.
  - > ⚠️ The legacy line-division overload `BuildConcaveHull(IEnumerable<FastVector3Int>, Grid, float scaleFactor, float concavity)` has been retired and now throws `NotSupportedException`. Switch to `ConcaveHullStrategy.Knn` or `ConcaveHullStrategy.EdgeSplit` instead.

Because the new overloads reuse the pooled implementations under the hood, behaviour (winding, pruning, GC profile) matches the grid versions—pick whichever signature best matches your data source.

## Gridless vs. Grid-Aware Quickstart

- Pick the **gridless** overloads when your points already live in world/local space (`Vector2`, `Vector3`, or `FastVector3Int` without a `Grid`). This keeps the hull math independent of Unity’s tile conversion layer.
- Pick the **grid-aware** overloads when you have cell coordinates tied to a `Grid` or `Tilemap` and you want the helper to respect `Grid.CellToWorld` so you can visualize the hull in scene space.

Gridless example — pure `Vector2` data for nav areas or spline fitting:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Extension;

// outlinePoints could come from mouse clicks or a baked spline
List<Vector2> outlinePoints = CollectOutlineSamples();
UnityExtensions.ConcaveHullOptions outlineOptions = UnityExtensions.ConcaveHullOptions.Default
    .WithStrategy(UnityExtensions.ConcaveHullStrategy.EdgeSplit)
    .WithBucketSize(32)
    .WithAngleThreshold(70f);

List<Vector2> hull = outlinePoints.BuildConcaveHull(outlineOptions);
```

Grid-aware example — `FastVector3Int` tiles aligned to a `Grid` for tilemaps or voxel data:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.DataStructure.Adapters;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Extension;

Grid grid = GetComponent<Grid>();
List<FastVector3Int> tileSamples = CollectTileCoordinates();
UnityExtensions.ConcaveHullOptions tileOptions = UnityExtensions.ConcaveHullOptions.Default
    .WithStrategy(UnityExtensions.ConcaveHullStrategy.Knn)
    .WithNearestNeighbors(5);

List<FastVector3Int> gridHull = tileSamples.BuildConcaveHull(grid, tileOptions);
```

See `Samples~/Spatial Structures - 2D and 3D/Scripts/HullUsageDemo.cs` for a runnable MonoBehaviour that draws both loops (cyan for gridless, yellow for grid-aware) and logs the strategy/neighbor counts so you can copy the pattern directly into your own tooling, or just open `Samples~/Spatial Structures - 2D and 3D/Scenes/HullUsageDemo.unity` and press Play to watch both flows without extra setup.

## Collinear Points & includeColinearPoints

- Convex hull helpers prune collinear points by default so only the true corners remain, even after grid-to-world projections introduce float skew.
- Opt into boundary retention by passing `includeColinearPoints: true` to `BuildConvexHull` (gridless) or its grid-aware overloads.
- Concave hulls inherit the pruned convex frontier; enabling collinear inclusion widens the seed set and can improve fidelity for dense edge sampling.
- The comprehensive tests `UnityExtensionsComprehensiveTests.ConvexHullDenseSamplesOnAllEdgesCollapseToCorners` (grid) and `.Vector2ConvexHullDenseSamplesCollapseToCorners` (gridless) cover both paths so you can trust the deterministic behavior.

```csharp
List<FastVector3Int> cornersOnly = gridPoints.BuildConvexHull(grid, includeColinearPoints: false);
List<FastVector3Int> withEdges = gridPoints.BuildConvexHull(grid, includeColinearPoints: true);
```
