# Improvement Plan (2025-11-26)

## Priority 2 — Maintainability & Developer Experience

### 5. Split `UnityExtensions` into focused modules *(In Progress)*

- **Problem**: `Runtime/Core/Extension/UnityExtensions.cs` is still a multi-thousand-line catch‑all (UI helpers, bounds/rect utilities, pooling helpers, etc.). Only the geometry block had been extracted, so most changes still collided in the root file and new helpers kept landing there by default.
- **2025-11-26 Progress**: Started carving the file into targeted partials by moving all bounds/rect/camera helpers into `UnityExtensions.Bounds.cs`. This includes center-point helpers, Rect↔Bounds conversions, RectTransform world rects, orthographic camera bounds, and the `BoundsInt`/`Bounds` aggregation utilities, reducing the root file by ~200 lines and isolating pooling dependencies. Followed up by extracting the UI helpers (`Slider.SetColors`, RectTransform offset setters) into `UnityExtensions.UI.cs`, and physics/collider helpers (`Rigidbody2D.Stop`, `Collider2D.IsCircleFullyContained`, `PolygonCollider2D.Invert`) into `UnityExtensions.Physics.cs`, keeping IMGUI and physics logic out of the geometry-heavy root. Remaining work: move the overlap/containment predicates and grid enumeration helpers into their own partial.
- **2025-11-27 Progress**: Finished isolating the overlap/containment predicates by leaving `UnityExtensions.Containment.cs` focused solely on fast `Bounds`/`BoundsInt` predicates and extracted the grid traversal helpers (`WithPadding`, `AllFastPositionsWithin`, `IsOnEdge2D`, etc.) into the new `UnityExtensions.GridTraversal.cs` partial. This removes the last of the grid enumeration logic from the containment block and keeps grid iteration utilities discoverable alongside other discrete-grid APIs.
- **2025-11-27 Progress (cont.)**: Split the monolithic `UnityExtensions.Grid.cs` into `UnityExtensions.GridConvexHull.cs` (all builders + pooled helpers) and `UnityExtensions.GridHullDiagnostics.cs` (Vector2/FastVector3Int containment + orientation helpers), and relocated the Vector2 concave entry points into `UnityExtensions.GridConcaveHull.cs`. This keeps convex builders, diagnostics, and concave wrappers isolated so edits no longer collide.
- **2025-11-28 Progress**: Split the original 80 KB `UnityExtensions.GridConcaveHull.cs` into four targeted partials: `GridConcaveHullKnn` (k-NN builders + helper sorts), `GridConcaveHullEdgeSplit` (edge-split + Vector2 variants), `GridConcaveHullDiagnostics` (axis-corner repair, point-in-hull, geometry helpers), and `GridConcaveHullLineDivision` (legacy line-divider). The dispatcher `GridConcaveHull.cs` now only routes strategies, eliminating the previous merge hotspot.
- **2025-11-28 Progress (cont.)**: Retired the unstable line-division strategy by stubbing `BuildConcaveHull` with a `NotSupportedException` and new `[Obsolete]` attribute, and added regression tests for the diagnostics helpers (`IsPositionInside` for both Vector2 and grid variants) to guard the newly split partial boundaries.
- **2025-11-28 Progress (cont. 2)**: Added explicit edge-split regression tests that verify the algorithm falls back to the convex hull when the angle threshold is small, reintroduces concave elbows when the threshold is generous, and now also guard against `bucketSize` starvation (small bucket sizes vs generous ones).
- **Next Step**: Monitor downstream packages for lingering references to the now-obsolete line-division entry point; once usage drops to zero, remove the stub entirely (plus README/docs notes) and announce the breaking change in the changelog.
- **Impact**: Smaller diffs, easier reviews, clearer ownership of complex helpers, and fewer merge conflicts when multiple teams touch `UnityExtensions`.

### 8. Concave Hull Parity & Regression Guardrails *(In Progress)*

- **Problem**: The grid and gridless concave hull entry points had drifted apart. Edge-split builds occasionally dropped interior “elbow” vertices (staircase/horseshoe/serpentine shapes) while the gridless FastVector path stayed sparse but inconsistent. Tight angle thresholds needed to fall back to the convex hull, yet loose thresholds and k-NN builds must retain axis corners. Randomized regression suites (`UnityExtensionsComprehensiveTests`) failed as the implementations diverged.
- **2025-11-27 Progress**: Added a shared axis-corner repair pass that can reinsert missing concave vertices using only the original input samples, deduplicates the resulting hull, and is gated so strict edge-split configurations stay convex while k-NN / high-angle builds regain their elbows. Added diagnostic/data-driven tests in `UnityExtensionsGridConcaveHullTests` plus changelog notes documenting the behavior change.
- **2025-11-28 Progress**: Extended the randomized grid + gridless regression harnesses with `HullRegressionRecorder`, capturing per-seed hull snapshots and dumping JSON diagnostics whenever an invariant fails (convex containment, duplicate detection, etc.), so future regressions come with ready-made repro assets.
- **2025-11-28 Progress (cont.)**: Introduced `ConcaveHullRepairStats` plus large-sample tests to ensure the axis-corner repair never exceeds the source point budget, and ported the axis-corner diagnostics to the gridless (`Vector2`/FastVector) suites so both entry points now log actionable data when elbows disappear.
- **2025-11-28 Progress (cont. 3)**: Hooked `ConcaveHullRepairStats` into the performance suite (see `ConcaveHullPerformanceTests.BuildConcaveHullEdgeSplitRepairStatsStayBounded`), so ≥10k point runs now assert bounded repair behaviour and log stats for CI dashboards.
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Aggregate the emitted repair stats in CI perf dashboards (averages, min/max) so regressions show up in build artifacts.
- **Impact**: Keeps grid and gridless concave hulls behaviorally aligned, prevents sparse concave inputs from regressing, and provides reproducible diagnostics when random-cloud suites fail.
