# Skill: Validate Before Commit

<!-- trigger: validate, commit, lint, check, verify, spell, cspell, spelling | Before completing any task (run linters!) | Core -->

**Trigger**: **MANDATORY** before completing any task that modifies code or documentation.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill for pre-commit validation:

- Before completing any coding task
- Before asking user to review changes
- Before any discussion of "done" or "complete"
- After making ANY modifications to files

For detailed linter commands and configurations, see [linter-reference](./linter-reference.md).
For troubleshooting common errors, see [validation-troubleshooting](./validation-troubleshooting.md).

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Fast changed-file preflight (MANDATORY before marking task complete)
npm run agent:preflight:fix

# Run all validations before pushing
npm run validate:prepush
```

Use `agent:preflight:fix` continuously while working to catch hook-class failures early on changed files.
Use `validate:prepush` for full CI parity before push.

**C#/tests/JSON/YAML/skill/CHANGELOG edits: run `npm run lint:spelling`** — cspell covers every file matching its `files` glob, not just Markdown. See [Rule 4: Spell-Check EVERY Change cspell Covers](#rule-4-spell-check-every-change-cspell-covers) for the failure-recovery decision tree. To add a new word: `npm run lint:spelling:add -- <bucket> <word>`.

---

## The Golden Rules

### Rule 0: Preflight Before Completion

Run `npm run agent:preflight:fix` before declaring a task complete.

Hooks are a last-resort safety net. Do not rely on hook-time auto-fixes as the normal workflow.

This catches hook-class failures early for changed files:

- Missing Unity `.meta` files on changed paths
- Unstaged Unity `.meta` companions for currently staged source files
- Spelling regressions in changed markdown files (`.md`, `.markdown`)
- Skill/context files approaching hard size limits
- LLM index/trigger drift when `.llm/` files changed
- Test-lint regressions with auto-fix for Unity null assertions

After creating any file/folder under Unity meta-required roots (`Runtime/`, `Editor/`, `Tests/`, `Samples~/`, `Shaders/`, `Styles/`, `URP/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`):

1. Generate `.meta` immediately with `./scripts/generate-meta.sh <path>`.
2. Run `npm run agent:preflight:fix` before continuing work.

Run `agent:preflight:fix` after staging candidate files (right before commit prep) so staged `.meta` companion drift is corrected before hooks run.
By default (no `-Paths`), preflight validates all changed files from git; passing `-Paths` scopes checks to those targets.

Preferred commit prep order:

1. Stage candidate files.
2. Run `npm run agent:preflight:fix`.
3. Resolve any reported issues.
4. Commit (hooks should only catch unexpected regressions).

### Rule 1: Format IMMEDIATELY After Every Change

**Do NOT batch formatting at the end of a task.** Format immediately after each file modification.

| File Type       | Formatter | Command                              |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| C# (`.cs`)      | CSharpier | `dotnet tool run csharpier format .` |
| Everything else | Prettier  | `npx prettier --write -- <file>`     |

### Rule 2: Run Linters IMMEDIATELY After Every Change

**Do NOT wait until task completion.** Run the appropriate linter after each file modification and fix issues before proceeding.

### Rule 3: Fix Before Moving On

1. Make a change to a file
2. Run the appropriate linter(s) for that file type
3. Fix any issues found
4. Only then move to the next file or task

---

## Common Mistakes

**Wrong** (batching until end):

1. Edit markdown file
2. Edit C# file
3. Edit YAML file
4. ... more edits ...
5. Run all formatters/linters at the end

**Correct** (format immediately after each):

1. Edit markdown -> `npx prettier --write -- <file>` -> `npm run lint:markdown`
2. Edit C# -> `dotnet tool run csharpier format .`
3. Edit YAML -> `npx prettier --write -- <file>` -> `npm run lint:yaml`
4. Edit test file -> `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/lint-tests.ps1` -> `dotnet tool run csharpier format .`

## Workflow by File Type

### Rule 4: Spell-Check EVERY Change cspell Covers

**MANDATORY, NOT just for docs.** cspell's `files` glob in [cspell.json](../../cspell.json) covers every file extension the pre-push and pre-commit hooks spell-check:

- Markdown: `**/*.{md,markdown}` (docs tree, root README/CHANGELOG/PLAN/AGENTS/CLAUDE, LLM instruction tree, GitHub templates)
- C#: `**/*.cs` (every source file under `Runtime/`, `Editor/`, `Tests/`, samples, and scripts)
- YAML: `**/*.{yml,yaml}` (workflows, yamllint config, any config YAML)
- JSON-family: `**/*.{json,jsonc,asmdef,asmref}` (package.json, `.asmdef`/`.asmref`, tool configs)
- JavaScript: `**/*.js` (scripts/ helpers, tests, hook scripts)

The `cspell.json` `files` glob and the hooks' pass-through list are kept in lock-step by `scripts/tests/test-cspell-hook-files-parity.sh` (run via `npm run validate:cspell-files-parity`). If you see drift, fix `cspell.json`'s `files` glob -- never narrow the hook pass-through.

If you modified ANY file in that set -- C# sources, tests, CHANGELOG, skill files, docs, YAML, JSON, `.asmdef`/`.asmref`, `.js` scripts -- you MUST run `npm run lint:spelling` before declaring work complete. The pre-push hook runs cspell on the same set and rejects the push on failure. Running it locally after each edit is faster and less disruptive than fighting the hook at the last moment. Do NOT mentally gate "this is a code change, no spelling matters" -- cspell lints identifiers in comments, XML docs, and log strings, which is where most typos actually land.

A Claude Code PostToolUse hook (`scripts/hooks/cspell-post-edit.js`, registered in the tracked [`.claude/settings.json`](../../.claude/settings.json)) auto-runs cspell after every Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit. The hook ships with the repo via `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, so teammates and fresh clones inherit it automatically -- there is no per-dev setup to forget. If you skip running `npm run lint:spelling` manually, the PostToolUse hook surfaces the feedback immediately instead of waiting for pre-push rejection.

PostToolUse semantics: the edit has ALREADY happened when the hook fires. Claude Code's docs ([hooks reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks)) say exit 2 on PostToolUse surfaces stderr to Claude (the model sees it and can fix in a follow-up edit) -- it does NOT undo the edit. The hook therefore acts as fast feedback, not a gate. Fix reported issues before moving to the next file, just as you would if you had run the linter manually.

Treat the hook as a SAFETY NET, not a substitute for manual validation. It does NOT fire when:

- CI runs (the hook is Claude Code specific).
- You edit files outside Claude Code (another IDE, scripted edits, `git rebase -i` edits).
- Node or `node_modules/.bin/cspell` is missing (fresh clones before `npm install` degrade silently -- run `npm install` to activate).
- The hook itself is disabled locally (see below).

For those scenarios -- and as a defense-in-depth check before declaring work complete -- run `npm run lint:spelling` manually. Manual invocation before completion remains the expectation.

To disable the hook temporarily (for noisy refactors, debugging the hook itself, or cspell upgrades), create `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) with:

```json
{ "hooks": { "PostToolUse": [] } }
```

The local file overrides the shared one. Delete it when done to re-enable.

Failure-recovery decision tree (when cspell reports `Unknown word`):

1. Is it a typo? Fix the source file. Done.
2. Is it a valid term already in a dictionary, just in a different case? cspell is case-insensitive here, so this should not happen — re-read the error.
3. Is it a valid term missing from the dictionary? Pick the right bucket using [linter-reference](./linter-reference.md#adding-words-to-dictionary):
   - Unity engine API → `unity-terms`
   - C# language / BCL type → `csharp-terms`
   - This package's public symbol → `package-terms`
   - General programming/tooling → `tech-terms`
   - Lint-error-code prefix (e.g. `UNH`, `PWS`) → root `words`
   - Project-specific, none of the above → root `words`
4. To add a word, prefer the helper script over editing `cspell.json` by hand:

   ```bash
   npm run lint:spelling:add -- <bucket> <word> [<word>...]
   # Example: npm run lint:spelling:add -- tech-terms reentrant reentrantly
   ```

   Buckets: `unity-terms`, `csharp-terms`, `package-terms`, `tech-terms`, `words` (root). The helper deduplicates, validates JSON round-trip, and rejects cross-bucket duplicates.

5. After editing `cspell.json`, re-run `npm run lint:spelling` AND `npm run lint:spelling:config` to catch case-redundant and cross-dictionary duplicates.

### C# Changes

```bash
# After EVERY .cs file modification (even single-line edits):
dotnet tool run csharpier format .
npm run lint:csharp-naming
npm run lint:spelling    # 🚨 MANDATORY — cspell lints C# comments/XML-doc/log-strings
```

Also verify license headers on new or modified files — see [license-headers](./license-headers.md).

### Documentation Changes

```bash
# After EVERY .md file modification:
npx prettier --write -- <file>
npm run lint:spelling    # 🚨 #1 CI failure cause!
npm run lint:docs         # Validates links
npm run lint:markdown     # Structural rules
```

### CHANGELOG or Project JSON Changes

```bash
# After EVERY CHANGELOG.md / package.json / asmdef / asmref edit:
npx prettier --write -- <file>
npm run lint:spelling    # 🚨 pre-push spell-checks CHANGELOG + JSON
```

### YAML Changes

```bash
# After EVERY .yml/.yaml file modification:
npx prettier --write -- <file>
npm run lint:yaml

# For workflow files (.github/workflows/*.yml), also run:
actionlint
```

### Test File Changes

```bash
# 🚨 MANDATORY: After EVERY test file modification:
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/lint-tests.ps1

# Recommended fast-path (runs test lint + safe auto-fixes on changed files):
npm run agent:preflight:fix

# Also run standard C# formatting:
dotnet tool run csharpier format .
npm run lint:csharp-naming
npm run lint:spelling    # 🚨 MANDATORY — cspell lints test comments + strings
```

**CRITICAL**: The test linter is **MANDATORY** for any test file changes (files in `Tests/` directory). You **MUST** run it **IMMEDIATELY** after each test file modification — do NOT batch these checks at the end of your task.

**Why this matters**: Test lifecycle lint failures will cause the pre-push hook to fail. Catching and fixing these issues early (after each file change) prevents frustrating failures when you try to push your commits.

### Assembly Definition Changes (`.asmdef`)

```bash
# 🚨 MANDATORY: After EVERY .asmdef file creation or modification:
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/lint-asmdef.ps1

# Also run standard JSON formatting:
npx prettier --write -- <file>
```

**CRITICAL**: The asmdef linter checks that assemblies with `overrideReferences: true` referencing `WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers` include `Sirenix.Serialization.dll` in `precompiledReferences`. Missing this causes CS0012/CS0311 compilation errors when Odin Inspector is installed. See [manage-assembly-definitions](./manage-assembly-definitions.md) for the standard template.

### Skill File and Context Changes (`.llm/skills/*.md`, [context](../context.md))

```bash
# 🚨 MANDATORY: After EVERY skill file or context.md modification:
npm run lint:spelling
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/lint-skill-sizes.ps1

# Recommended strict changed-file check (fails on critical near-limit sizes):
npm run agent:preflight

# Also run standard markdown formatting:
npx prettier --write -- <file>
npm run lint:markdown
```

**CRITICAL**: Skill files and [context](../context.md) have a **500-line hard limit** enforced by the pre-commit hook. Files exceeding this limit **CANNOT be committed** and require human judgment to split or reduce.

`agent:preflight` treats critical near-limit sizes as failures for changed files, so growth pressure is addressed before the pre-commit hook becomes the final stop.

| Lines   | Action Required                                          |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| <300    | No action needed                                         |
| 300-500 | Consider splitting preemptively to avoid future blockers |
| >500    | **MUST split before commit** — hook will reject the file |

**Why this matters**: Splitting large skill files requires human judgment (deciding topic boundaries, updating cross-references). Catching size issues early prevents blocking commits when you've completed all other work.

### LLM Instructions Changes ([LLM context](../context.md), skills index)

```bash
# 🚨 MANDATORY: After ANY change to .llm/context.md or skills index generation:
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/lint-llm-instructions.ps1

# Auto-fix mode (rolls back MD025 violations from generated content):
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/lint-llm-instructions.ps1 -Fix
```

**CRITICAL**: The skills index must NEVER introduce H1 or H2 headings into the [LLM context file](../context.md). Generated skill entries must use H3 or lower. The LLM instructions lint script validates this and the `-Fix` flag can auto-correct violations.

**Tests**: Run `pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/tests/test-llm-instructions-lint.ps1` to verify the lint script itself (test cases covering generator output validation, lint correctness, H1/H2 detection, and pattern matching).

## What Gets Validated

The `npm run validate:prepush` command runs these checks:

1. **validate:content** — Documentation and formatting
   - `lint:docs` — Markdown links (no backtick `.md` refs)
   - `lint:markdown` — Markdownlint rules
   - `format:md:check` — Prettier markdown formatting
   - `format:json:check` — Prettier JSON/asmdef formatting
   - `format:yaml:check` — Prettier YAML formatting
   - `validate:lint-error-codes` — cspell coverage for every `^[A-Z]{2,}\d{3}$` prefix emitted by `scripts/lint-*.{ps1,js}`, `scripts/tests/test-lint-*.{ps1,js,sh}`, or `.githooks/*`

2. **lint:spelling** — CSpell validation on the repository

3. **eol:check** — Line endings (CRLF, no BOM)

4. **validate:tests** — Test lifecycle lint (Track() usage) and cspell lint-error-code contract regression test

5. **lint:csharp-naming** — C# naming conventions

---

## Critical Link Formatting Rules

For complete link formatting rules, escaping patterns, and linting rules, see [markdown-reference](./markdown-reference.md).

Key requirements:

- **ALL internal links MUST use `./` or `../` prefix** — no bare paths
- **NEVER use backtick-wrapped file references** — use proper markdown links
- **NEVER use absolute GitHub Pages paths** — no `/unity-helpers/...` paths

---

## Documentation Checklist

Before completing ANY task:

### Prettier Self-Check (MANDATORY)

- [ ] Did I run `npx prettier --write -- <file>` IMMEDIATELY after EVERY non-C# file?
- [ ] Did I verify each file with `npx prettier --check -- <file>`?
- [ ] Did I check config files too? (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, `package.json`, etc.)
- [ ] Final check: `npx prettier --check -- .` passes?

### For New Features

- [ ] Feature documentation added/updated
- [ ] XML documentation on all public types/members
- [ ] At least one working code sample
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry in `### Added` section
- [ ] llms.txt updated if feature adds new capabilities

### For Bug Fixes

- [ ] CHANGELOG entry in `### Fixed` section
- [ ] Documentation corrected if it described wrong behavior

### For API Changes

- [ ] All documentation referencing old API updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry (in `### Changed`, marked Breaking if applicable)
- [ ] XML docs updated
- [ ] Code samples updated

---

## Pre-Existing Warnings

Some lint warnings may exist in the main branch. Focus on:

1. **New warnings** introduced by your changes
2. **Failing checks** (exit code 1)

If `validate:content` and `lint:csharp-naming` pass, your changes are ready.

---

## CLI Argument Safety

When passing file lists to CLI tools (prettier, markdownlint, yamllint, etc.), ALWAYS use a `--` end-of-options separator before the file arguments.

### Why

Without `--`, a staged filename like `--plugin=./evil.js` or `--config=malicious.yml` would be interpreted as a CLI option, not a filename. This is an option injection vulnerability.

### Pattern

```bash
# WRONG - filenames can be interpreted as options
npx --no-install prettier --write "${FILES[@]}"

# CORRECT - `--` prevents filenames from being treated as options
npx --no-install prettier --write -- "${FILES[@]}"
```

This applies to ALL tools that accept file arguments:

- `prettier --write -- "${FILES[@]}"`
- `markdownlint --fix --config X -- "${FILES[@]}"`
- `yamllint -c config.yaml -- "${FILES[@]}"`

In PowerShell scripts, add `'--'` to argument arrays before file paths:

```powershell
$cmdArgs = @('--yes', 'prettier', '--write', '--') + $filePaths
```
