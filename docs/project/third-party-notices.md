CC0 1.0 Universal

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR
THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR
DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.

The person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that
he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work
and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights.
   A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related
   or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").

2. Waiver.
   To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably
   and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's
   Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action.

3. Public License Fallback.
   Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
   ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to
   the maximum extent permitted. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so
   judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
   transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
   unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
   in the Work.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
   a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work.
   c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work.
   d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
      this CC0 or use of the Work.
