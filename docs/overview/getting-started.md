# Getting Started with Unity Helpers

**This guide introduces key features that can help reduce repetitive coding patterns.**

Unity Helpers is a toolkit used in commercial games that reduces common boilerplate patterns in Unity development. This guide covers the top features and basic usage patterns, whether you're a beginner or a senior engineer.

## Core Features

**Three core principles:**

### 1. 🎯 Reduced Boilerplate

**Common APIs:**

- Random selection with weights? → `random.NextWeightedIndex(weights)`
- Auto-wire components? → `[SiblingComponent] private Animator animator;`
- Gaussian distribution? Perlin noise? → Built-in, one method call

**Self-documenting code:**

```csharp
[SiblingComponent] private Animator animator;                      // Clear intent
[ParentComponent(OnlyAncestors = true)] private Rigidbody2D rb;  // Explicit search
[ChildComponent(MaxDepth = 1)] private Collider2D[] colliders;   // Limited scope
```

**Error messages:**

- Missing components? → Full GameObject path + component type
- Invalid queries? → Explanation of what went wrong + how to fix it
- Schema issues? → Specific guidance for your serialization problem

### 2. ⚡ Performance Characteristics

**Speed improvements measured in benchmarks:**

- **10-15x faster in benchmarks** random generation ([benchmark details](../performance/random-performance.md))
- **Up to 100x faster in benchmarks** reflection ([benchmark details](../performance/reflection-performance.md))
- **O(log n)** spatial queries tested with millions of objects ([benchmark details](../performance/spatial-tree-2d-performance.md))
- **Zero GC** with buffering pattern

**Benchmark Results:**

- Stable 60 FPS with 1000+ AI agents ([benchmark details](../performance/spatial-tree-2d-performance.md))
- No allocation spikes from pooled collections
- Deterministic replays with seedable RNG

### 3. ✅ Testing & Compatibility

- ✅ **8,000+ automated tests** - Edge cases are handled through test coverage
- ✅ **Shipped in commercial games** - Used at scale in production
- ✅ **IL2CPP/WebGL compatible** - Works with aggressive compilers
- ✅ **Schema evolution** - Player saves maintain compatibility across updates
- ✅ **SINGLE_THREADED optimized** - Reduced overhead on WebGL

**Key capabilities:**

- Edge cases are handled through test coverage
- Consistent behavior in editor and builds
- Player data compatibility maintained across updates

## Choose Your Path

### 🎯 Path 1: "I Have a Specific Problem"

Jump directly to the solution you need:

**Performance Issues?**

3. Explore category-specific guides as needed

### 💡 Path 3: "I Learn Best from Examples"

See it working first, understand the theory later:

1. Follow the [3 Quick Examples](#three-quick-examples) below
2. Explore the Samples~ folder (see sample README files in the repo) for DI integration examples
3. Modify examples for your specific needs
4. Read the detailed guides when you need to go deeper

## Installation

See the [Installation section](../readme.md#installation) in the main README for detailed installation instructions using:

- **OpenUPM** (Recommended) — Easy version management via Package Manager or CLI
- **Git URL** — Direct from GitHub, great for CI/CD pipelines
- **NPM Registry** — For teams already using NPM scoped registries
- **Source** — Import `.unitypackage` from releases, or clone the repository

After installation, verify the package appears in **Window → Package Manager** under "My Registries" or "In Project".

---

## Three Quick Examples

### Example 1: Random Generation (Beginner)

**Problem:** Unity's `UnityEngine.Random` is slow and not seedable.

**Solution:**

```csharp
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Random;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Extension;

public class LootDrop : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Performance comparison available in benchmarks
        IRandom rng = PRNG.Instance;

        // Basic usage
        int damage = rng.Next(10, 20);
        float chance = rng.NextFloat();

        // Weighted random selection
        string[] loot = { "Common", "Rare", "Epic", "Legendary" };
        float[] weights = { 0.6f, 0.25f, 0.10f, 0.05f };
        int index = rng.NextWeightedIndex(weights);
        Debug.Log($"Dropped: {loot[index]}");
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Don't use `UnityEngine.Random` and `PRNG.Instance` together in the
> same class - pick one and stick with it for consistent results.

### Example 2: Component Wiring (Beginner)

**Problem:** Writing `GetComponent` calls everywhere is tedious and error-prone.

**Solution:**

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;

public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Auto-finds SpriteRenderer on same GameObject
    [SiblingComponent]
    private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer;

    // Auto-finds Rigidbody2D in parent hierarchy
    [ParentComponent]
    private Rigidbody2D rigidbody;

    // Auto-finds all Collider2D in immediate children only
    [ChildComponent(OnlyDescendants = true, MaxDepth = 1)]
    private Collider2D[] childColliders;

    void Awake()
    {
        // One call wires all attributed components
        this.AssignRelationalComponents();

        // Now use them
        spriteRenderer.color = Color.red;
        rigidbody.velocity = Vector2.up * 5f;
        Debug.Log($"Found {childColliders.Length} child colliders");
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Don't call `AssignRelationalComponents()` in `Update()` -
> it should only run once during initialization (Awake/Start).

#### Using With DI Containers (VContainer/Zenject/Reflex)

- If you use dependency injection, you can auto-populate relational fields right after DI injection.
- Quick setup:
  - VContainer: in `LifetimeScope.Configure`, call `builder.RegisterRelationalComponents()`.
  - Zenject/Extenject: add `RelationalComponentsInstaller` to your `SceneContext` and (optionally) enable the scene scan on initialize.
  - Reflex: attach `RelationalComponentsInstaller` alongside your `SceneScope`. The installer binds the assigner, hydrates the active scene, and can listen for additive scenes. Use `ContainerRelationalExtensions` helpers (`InjectWithRelations`, `InstantiateGameObjectWithRelations`, etc.) when spawning objects through the container.
- Samples: See sample folders in the repository for VContainer, Zenject, and Reflex integration examples
- Full guide with scenarios and testing tips: [Dependency Injection Integrations](../features/relational-components/relational-components.md#dependency-injection-integrations)

### Example 3: Spatial Queries (Intermediate)

**Problem:** Finding nearby objects with `FindObjectsOfType` and distance checks is O(n) and slow.

**Solution:**

```csharp
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.DataStructure;
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class EnemyManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private QuadTree2D<Enemy> enemyTree;
    private List<Enemy> nearbyBuffer = new(64); // Reusable buffer

    void Start()
    {
        // Build tree once (O(n log n))
        Enemy[] enemies = FindObjectsOfType<Enemy>();
        enemyTree = new QuadTree2D<Enemy>(enemies, e => e.transform.position);
    }

    public List<Enemy> GetEnemiesNearPlayer(Vector2 playerPos, float radius)
    {
        nearbyBuffer.Clear();

        // Fast query: O(log n) instead of O(n)
        enemyTree.GetElementsInRange(playerPos, radius, nearbyBuffer);

        return nearbyBuffer;
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake:** Spatial trees are **immutable** - you must rebuild the tree
> when enemy positions change. For frequently moving objects, use `SpatialHash2D` instead.
